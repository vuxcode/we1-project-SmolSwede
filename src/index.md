# Welcome to SWBI: Smols World-Building Initiative

**Project Name:** *The Frontier Colony Initiative*  
**Setting:** A grounded, high-stakes colonization project in a vast fantasy world filled with danger, opportunity, and deep historical echoes.

## About the World

The world of the Frontier Colony Initiative is a massive, diverse planet bearing many similarities to Earth in geography and climate, but populated by a rich tapestry of civilizations drawn from the Warhammer Fantasy setting—albeit stripped of overt magic. These cultures range from disciplined Dwarfs and proud Elven empires to chaotic Beastmen and secretive Skaven. In addition to these, the world also hosts human powers from across analogues of our own historical periods, from the late Roman era to the age of sail and empire.

Mythical creatures roam land, sea, and sky. Sea dragons claim deepwater lairs, while enormous Great Eagles patrol the mountain winds. Dragons of various sizes, akin to those from Game of Thrones, lurk far from the colony’s location but still loom in the background as apex threats. The natural world is wild, ancient, and sometimes hostile—making survival a challenge even without the interference of sentient enemies.

The continent where the colony is located is known for its harsh winters, mild summers, and rugged coastlines. It is a land that demands adaptation and punishes weakness. Yet it also offers vast untapped resources, strategic positions, and a chance to stake a permanent human claim in a contested world.

## The Colony Project

The colony itself is a self-sufficient human settlement established on the shores of a vast ocean. Nestled near a natural harbor flanked by hills and fed by several inland rivers, it enjoys a tactically advantageous location for defense, trade, and transport. It is built to endure brutal winters, make the most of short but productive summers, and weather seasonal rains that flood the lower valleys during autumn.

Using only technology from before the 1960s, the colony employs practical infrastructure like district heating, steam or diesel power, and pre-modern building materials and design philosophies. Logistics are a challenge, as outside supplies can only arrive twice per year, meaning long-term planning and local resource extraction are vital.

Fortified positions guard the harbor approaches and inland routes, while trained militia protect the people and enforce security. The settlement is designed for scalability, but every step of its growth must contend with the geopolitical realities of a complex, hostile world.

## Why SWBI?

The Strategic World-Building Initiative was founded to explore a simple but powerful idea: what happens when grounded human logistics, engineering, and strategy collide with a myth-rich fantasy world? This project strips away magic and super-science to focus on realism and consequence. Every weapon must be maintained, every building heated, every logistic chain respected.

Rather than relying on fantasy tropes or technological miracles, the colony is an experiment in disciplined survival. It tests how well 20th-century technology and doctrine can hold up in a world of medieval empires, roaming monsters, and unpredictable political alliances.

SWBI encourages deliberate, layered storytelling. The colony is not a power fantasy—it is a fragile foothold. It represents humanity’s attempt to build something stable in a world that does not want it to succeed. Whether it will thrive, stagnate, or fall is not preordained. That’s the point.

By grounding the setting in material limitations and social complexity, the SWBI approach fosters immersive realism. Every supply run matters. Every new neighbor brings risk. And every winter, the people must fight not just for dominance—but for survival.
