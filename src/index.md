# Welcome to SWBI: SmolSwedes World-Building Initiative

**Project Name:** *The Frontier Colony Initiative*  
**Status:** Phase 1: Establishment and Fortification.  
**Setting:** A grounded, high-stakes colonization project in a vast fantasy world filled with danger, opportunity, and deep historical echoes.

## About the World

The world of the Frontier Colony Initiative is a massive, diverse planet bearing many similarities to Earth in geography and climate, but way larger in size and populated by a rich tapestry of civilizations drawn from the Warhammer Fantasy setting—albeit stripped of overt magic. These cultures range from disciplined Dwarfs and proud Elven empires to chaotic Beastmen and secretive Skaven. In addition to these, the world also hosts human powers from across analogues of our own historical periods, from the late Roman era to the age of sail and empire.

Mythical creatures roam land, sea, and sky. Sea dragons claim deepwater lairs, while enormous Great Eagles patrol the mountain winds. Dragons of various sizes, akin to those from Game of Thrones, while hopefully far from the colony’s location they still loom in the background as apex threats. The natural world is wild, ancient, and sometimes hostile—making survival a challenge even without the interference of sentient enemies.

The island or more like mini continent where the colony is located is known for its harsh winters, mild summers, and rugged coastlines. It is a land that demands adaptation and punishes weakness. Yet it also offers vast untapped resources, strategic positions, and a chance to stake a permanent human claim in a contested world.

## The Colony Project

The colony itself is a self-sufficient human settlement established on the shores of a vast ocean. Nestled near a natural harbor flanked by hills and fed by several inland rivers, it enjoys a tactically advantageous location for defense, trade, and transport. It is built to endure brutal winters, make the most of short but productive summers, and weather seasonal rains that flood the lower valleys during autumn.

Using only technology from before the 1960s, the colony employs practical infrastructure like district heating, steam or diesel power, and pre-modern building materials and design philosophies. Logistics are a challenge, as "modern" outside supplies can only arrive twice per year, meaning long-term planning and local resource extraction are vital.

Fortified positions guard the harbor approaches and inland routes, while trained militia protect the people and enforce security. The settlement is designed for scalability, but every step of its growth must contend with the geopolitical realities of a complex, hostile world.

While most magic is "removed" or not pressent atleast, we still have some "magical materials" like suspendium that enables crafts to hover and fly, but its effect diminishes with altitude. This leads us to airships that are a rare but powerful presence in the world of SWBI. These impressive machines blend advanced design principles with the floating capabilities of the special metal known as suspendium. 
While capable of navigating through complex airspace and performing advanced maneuvers, airships are limited by their reliance on this rare and costly material.

As such, airships have a fixed operational ceiling above the ground. This makes steep terrain — such as mountain ranges, cliffs, or deep valleys and seas — a serious navigational challenge. Pilots must be constantly aware of the elevation below, as dramatic changes in ground level can force rapid and dangerous altitude adjustments.

Due to the high cost of suspendium and the complexity of maintaining these vehicles, airships are relatively few in number. Most are low-flying by design, skimming over forests, rivers, and plains rather than soaring above the clouds. They are often reserved for critical tasks: long-distance scouting, troop and passenger transport, or hauling valuable cargo between hard-to-reach locations over the wastness of the mainland. Despite their limitations, airships are a symbol of innovation and ambition in a world otherwise grounded in early industrial and low-fantasy constraints. Their presence marks a strategic advantage, a technological edge in a setting where mobility and high-ground awareness can mean the difference between survival and defeat.

## Why SWBI?

The Strategic World-Building Initiative was founded to explore a simple but powerful idea: what happens when grounded human logistics, engineering, and strategy collide with a myth-rich fantasy world? This project strips away over-powered magic (things similar to say the chaos gods) and super-science to focus on realism and consequence. Every weapon must be maintained, every building heated, every logistic chain respected.

Rather than relying on fantasy tropes or technological miracles, the colony is an experiment in disciplined survival. It tests how well 20th-century technology and doctrine can hold up in a world of medieval or even pre-medival empires, roaming monsters, and unpredictable political alliances.

SWBI encourages deliberate, layered storytelling. The colony is not a power fantasy—it is a fragile foothold. It represents humanity’s attempt to build something stable in a world that does not want it to succeed. Whether it will thrive, stagnate, or fall is not preordained. That’s the point.

By grounding the setting in material limitations and social complexity, the SWBI approach fosters immersive realism. Every supply run matters. Every new neighbor brings risk. And every winter, the people must fight not just for dominance—but for survival.
