# Project Instructions

Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/we1/lessons/major-project-brief/

The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your website, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT!

# Project Notes

  > You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it

  Haven't realy thouth about makeing project notes (Whoops!)

# Project Summary

  > Before the final submission date you should include a "PROJECT SUMMARY" in this section here.

  This project demonstrates my learning and development process while building a website using a static site generator. Since I apparently hate myself or extremely curious maybe even both, and then desided to use Eleventy (the static site generator used in this project) with all of its quriks and features.

  ### So What have I been learing on top of all the HTML and CSS in the standard course?
    - Elevnenty (11ty): Is a simple, flexible, and fast static site generator written in JavaScript. It transforms plain text files like Markdown, HTML and Nunjucks and similar files into a complete website.

    - Nunjucks (.njk): Is a templating language for JavaScript and is used to generate dynamic HTML by combining templates with data.

    - Markdown (.md): Is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text into structured documents, such as web pages (like this project), documentation, and README files.

    - GitHub Actions: Is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) platform build directly into GitHub. It lets you automate tasks like building, testing and deploying code whenever certain events happen in the affected repository(Push, Pull request or Release). It uses YAML-workflows like seen bellow.

    - GitHub Workflows: Is a configuration file (written in .yml or .yaml) that lives in the .github/workflows/ directory of your repository. It defines when and how your automation runs using GitHub Actions (as seen above)
  
  During the process of building this web site, I redescovered that CSS is my arch nemessis and not the most fun part of the project to be nice about it. However, I found doing the "backendy" stuff way more fun and engaging and therefor spent a greater amount of time working with that, even when it did not want to work with me :(.

  I also noticed some similarities (between 11ty and what I did on the ASP.NET couse) with how the web page build struckture was structured and from my hazy memories of this it felt pretty similar for me at least (might not be similar at all). After some light reading on the internet (and some consulting with ChatGPT to get a better under standing of what they have in common or not when the Humans failed me in explaining) I found out that some of it is true but they are totaly diffrent as well.

  And I feel that I have filled the gaps in my knowlage from said ASP.NET couse (since we only spent one week on every step) for atleast the HTML, CSS and some of the JavaScript stuff (not that I made any).

  ### What are somethings I could have done better?
    - Time management is a big one. Should have started much sooner as well since it felt like a mega time crunch at the end (especially with the GitHub Actions and Workflows).

    - Taking notes at all. Would have made this part easier. (Problems not included here)

    - Make more comments not that I have had problems with not knowing what things do (except for brand new things) but it would help others understand on thier own.
