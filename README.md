## Problem 01! - Fixed! | 2025-04-28
  - 11ty copies everything into the public dir? 
  > Fixed by changing input and output via the method instead of named export. | 2025-04-28 | (See link: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#configuration-3)
## Problem 02! - Fixed! | 2025-04-28
  - 11ty builds the page but it is not displaying it in the browser. It only displays "Cannot GET /" and the title says "Error".
  > Fixed by either using index.md instead of mainPage.md or using 'link: "/"' in page relelations section. | 2025-04-28
## Thought 01 | 2025-04-30
  - Use 11ty:s navigation plugin for navigation between pages and on said pages. 
## Problem 03! - Fixed! | 2025-04-30
  - TOC (Table Of Contents) plugin wont work :(.
  > Fixed by moving the TOC plugin from elventyConfig to function(eleventyConfig) | 2025-05-01
